## Set up development environment

First, create a new project:

```bash
$ ./scripts/init.sh [project_name]
```

Run the below script to build the Docker image and run all the services:

```bash
$ ./scripts/dev.sh [project]
```

## Debugging

Instead of using `breakpoint()`, add the following line to your code where you
want a debug:
```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Attach to running container to use debugger. To get the container ID, run `docker ps`
and look in the `NAMES` column.

```bash
$ docker attach [container_id]
```

### Backend server

Code for the web server is in `mage_ai/server/`.

### Front-end app

Code for the front-end app is in `mage_ai/frontend/`.
