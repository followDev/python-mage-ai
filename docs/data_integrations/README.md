## Overview

Data integration is synchronizing data from an external system to an internal system or vice versa.

### Syncing external data → internal systems

If you have data in 3rd party systems (e.g other SaaS tools) and you want that data available in
your database, data warehouse, or data lake, you can use Mage to sync data between those systems.

### Syncing internal data → external systems (reverse)

Your internal database or data warehouse may contain application data generated by your
users or customers. This data can be valuable if used in conjunction with 3rd party SaaS tools.

You can use Mage to sync data from your internal systems, and have that data appear in various
3rd party SaaS tools.
