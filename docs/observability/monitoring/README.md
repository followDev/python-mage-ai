Here are the following metrics that are monitored for each pipeline and block:

- Pipeline runs completed successfully
- Pipeline runs failed
- Block runs completed successfully
- Block runs failed
- How long each block ran for
- *CPU usage for each block run (coming soon)*
- *Memory usage for each block run (coming soon)*
- *Data validation success for each block (coming soon)*
- *Data validation failure for each block (coming soon)*
